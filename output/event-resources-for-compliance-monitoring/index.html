                        <h3>Pre-Event Monitoring</h3>
<p>Pre-event monitoring involves conducting thorough checks and risk assessments to identify potential compliance issues before the event takes place. This stage is critical for mitigating risks early on.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Risk Assessment and Mitigation</h3>
<p>Risk assessment should be an ongoing process that evaluates potential compliance risks associated with event planning and execution. Implementing effective mitigation strategies can significantly reduce these risks.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Documentation and Record-Keeping</h3>

                        <h3>Incident Reporting Procedures</h3>

                        <h3>Post-Event Evaluation</h3>
